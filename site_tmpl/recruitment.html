						<h2>Hi!</h2>
						We are Lens and Lights, a group of students with a shared passion
						for event production. We amplify our technical experience and
						leadership skills by working in teams, with clients, and with
						professional grade equipment. Throughout the year we support
						countless events with quality lighting, sound, and projection
						services.

				<div class="col-lg mb-3">
					<h2>Lighting</h2>
					<p>
						LNL provides lighting for a variety of events with our inventory of
						professional grade equipment. We illuminate events including simple
						lighting on a stage, full on dance parties, stage performances, live
						bands, receptions, outdoor area lighting, and large robotics
						competitions! The equipment we own includes a variety of
						conventional, LED, and Arc fixtures allowing our members tons of
						creativity! Highlights include several pairs of moving head spot
						fixtures, many moving head LED wash fixtures, wireless uplights, and
						over 100 conventional Source Four fixtures. We also have a variety of
						lighting consoles to control them all ranging from small analog
						consoles to large and complex consoles in the EOS and HOG families.
						Now if all that sounds like a bunch of jibberish, please come help
						with one of our events and we will be happy to explain everything
						from the basics through the advanced. We also encourage you to
						checkout our workshops!

					<h2>Sound</h2>
					<p>
						Lens and Lights does many different sound events on campus! They
						range from smaller events like providing a wireless microphone for a
						speaker, to a Capella shows, to music on the quad, to full blown
						robotics competitions like BattleCry at WPI. We have several
						different speakers, mics, consoles and more we use to have the best
						event possible! If you've ever been interested in how sound gets
						from something like your phone out to big speakers, feel free to stop
						by a sound event and we will show you the ropes (...and the cables)!

					<h2>Projection</h2>
					<p>
						LNL maintains several projectors on campus, capable of showing theatre
						quality, full-length feature films. Our digital projector is used to
						show Soccomâ€™s weekend films in the Fuller Upper Perreault Hall. We
						also maintain two 35/70mm projectors that are more than 50 years old.
						Members get to be trained on each of these projectors, starting with
						one of the two 16mm projectors and working their way up. Setup for
						movies happens at 7:30pm on Saturday and Sunday before each movie
						Soccom has scheduled. Come say hello and learn about the fun that is
						film.
