LNL Password Reset

You're receiving this e-mail because you requested a password reset for your user account at {{ request.get_host }}, Please go
    to the following page and choose a new password:

{% block reset_link %}
{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'accounts:reset:confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}
{% endblock %}

Your username, in case you've forgotten: {{ user.username }}. If this isn't you, you can safely ignore this email.

    You can log in at {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'accounts:login' %}. If you use WPI CAS, you can
    continue to use that, in addition to having your manual password set.

    Thanks for using the LNL Database
